# Cybersecurity Research Blog

Welcome to my personal cybersecurity research blog, hosted on **GitHub Pages** and powered by **Jekyll**.  
This space is where I publish deep-dive write-ups, technical explorations, and original research in areas such as:

- Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) simulation & evasion
- Malware development and anti-analysis techniques
- Shellcode Obfuscation
- UAC Bypass and LPE
- Exploitation research (kernel, memory manipulation, obfuscation)
- Vulnerability discovery and responsible disclosure
